# Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

The first challenges unlock on December 1st at 00:00 EST/05:00 UTC, and continue every day throughout the month.

You can read more about the challenge [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about).

The WinAdmins Leaderboard is [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private/view/1506887). The join code is pinned in the "Advent of Code 2021" thread in the `#community` channel.
